# Doppelgänger
I saw this framework's doppelgänger the other day.

## Getting Started
For Node:
```javascript
//Don't use this quite yet. :)
```

## Documentation
The code is the documentation for now.

## Examples
_(Coming soon)_
Really, nothing is ready yet, stop reading.

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
From the cli:
```
npm install
grunt
```

## Release History
